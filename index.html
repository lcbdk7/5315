      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a "lighter" virtual machine that holds everything necessary to run an application. It is based on Linux containers and is open-sourced. A container "provides operating-system-level virtualization by abstracting the "user space" ". Containers are used to bundle up the user space because each container gets its own user space it allows the operating system to be shared across containers. A container is basically an instant snapshot of an applications system. Docker creates said containers on top of an operating system and makes it easier to link containers together to create an application. Docker enables the ability for anyone to package on application anywhere, and then run anywhere, by isolating the app and making it independent of a system through the use of containers.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a web server that uses "non-threaded, event-driven architecture." It is also used for reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming and other uses. It is the fastest web server currently available and is most popular among high traffic websites. NGINX architecture allows it to have low memory usage and high concurrency. The event-driven architecture consists of requests being conducted in a single thread instead of new processes being created for each request. NGINX there is one master process that controls multiple worker processes. The worker processes do the legwork(the actual processing) while the master maintains them. Any request made can be fulfilled concurrently with another request by the worker because of the event-driven architecture.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine also known as a VM is basically a digital imitation of a real computer that is able to execute programs like a real computer. Virtual Machines work through the use of a hypervisor, which runs on a host machine. It is through the connection to the host machine that gives the VM the resources to work like a real computer like RAM and CPU. The resources provided are split between multiple VM's and the specific division of the resources is based on what is needed to run an application. The VM houses the resources to run the application as well as the application itself. It also houses its own fully operational operation-system. The hypervisor is a key part of VM's working properly as they allow for the sharing of resources among all the VM's running on top of the hypervisor.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>Digital Ocean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. Similar to Amazon Web Services. Digital Ocean sells itself based on its simplicity and is targeted only towards developers. In order to make use of the infrastructure developers set up VM's which are known as 'droplets'. Droplets can be chosen based on the size and the region of the world the data will be run in as well as which Linux operating system it uses. </p>
